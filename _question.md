# CHALLENGE 2

Write a function called `quotient` that takes two numbers, x and y (which you may assume are both positive integers), and returns the integral quotient of x/y, discarding any remainder.

For example, calling `quotient(9,4)` should return 2 because four goes into nine twice with a remainder of one left over. This function is easy to write if you use the `Math.floor` function; the challenge in this exercise is to write quotient using only the standard arithmetic operators.
